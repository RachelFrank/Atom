# Your keymap
#
# Atom keymaps work similarly to style sheets. Just as style sheets use
# selectors to apply styles to elements, Atom keymaps use selectors to associate
# keystrokes with events in specific contexts. Unlike style sheets however,
# each selector can only be declared once.
#
# You can create a new keybinding in this file by typing "key" and then hitting
# tab.
#
# Here's an example taken from Atom's built-in keymap:
#
# 'atom-text-editor':
#   'enter': 'editor:newline'
#
# 'atom-workspace':
#   'ctrl-shift-p': 'core:move-up'
#   'ctrl-p': 'core:move-down'

'.editor':
  'alt-cmd-w': 'editor:toggle-soft-wrap'
  'alt-cmd-shift-l': 'window:reload'
  'alt-cmd-e': 'html-entitize:encode'
  'alt-cmd-d': 'html-entitize:decode'
  'ctrl-1': 'wrap-in-tag:wrap'
'atom-workspace atom-text-editor:not([mini])':
  'cmd-enter': 'r-exec:send-command'
'atom-workspace atom-text-editor.autocomplete-active':
  'tab': 'snippets:next-tab-stop'
  'shift-tab': 'snippets:previous-tab-stop'

# Keybinding Resolver: `Cmd+.` on macOS and `Ctrl+.` on other platforms. See the
# Debugging Guide for more information:
