## Abstract

Each tracker creates duplicate load balancer replications of itself with a different ip.

ex. `http://gazellian.191.238.293.291/id/torrent-name`

Each user creates duplicate files that load balance (basic torrent concept).

## Philosophy and political modeling

Politically modeled after reddit in the sense that users will be able to create content within any meta tag but will have the higher level tags controlled by a group of moderators.


Meta data will function like git repositories. Data will be transffered and merged with each other. The difference between git is:

1.  Merge conflicts will be forced based on time data
2.  There will be no upstream master. They are all parallel.

### User Moderation

Users will be able sign into any site with the same ID.

### Data blockchain and reverting

When meta data is updated it will be compaired and hashed against existing data and then propigated across the greater system similar to DNS.
